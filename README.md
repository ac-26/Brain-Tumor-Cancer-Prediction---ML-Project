# Brain Tumor Cancer Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting brain tumor malignancy using various classification algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on provided features.

## Overview

The dataset contains information about tumor characteristics, and several machine learning algorithms are applied to predict tumor malignancy. Key algorithms include Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Data standardization is used to enhance model performance.

## Project Structure

- `BrainTumorProject.ipynb`: Main script containing the implementation of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `BrainTumorData.csv`: Dataset file used for model training and testing.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Includes data visualization and preprocessing steps.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares performance of multiple algorithms using cross-validation.
- **Data Standardization**: Improves model accuracy by standardizing the dataset.

## Results

The project achieved a mean accuracy of 97.3% using the SVM model after standardizing the data. Performance metrics and comparison plots are generated for each model.
